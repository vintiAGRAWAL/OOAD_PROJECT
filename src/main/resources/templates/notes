Based on the code provided, it appears that the InventoryControllerFactory class is implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the Model (data), View (presentation), and Controller (logic).

There are several other design patterns that could be implemented in this code, depending on the specific requirements and needs of the application. Here are a few examples:

Singleton Design Pattern: This pattern could be used to ensure that only one instance of the InventoryRepo is created and shared across the application.

Factory Design Pattern: This pattern could be used to create different types of Inventory objects based on specific criteria, such as the type of inventory or the user's role.

Decorator Design Pattern: This pattern could be used to dynamically add or remove features or behaviors to the Inventory object, such as adding a discount or calculating tax.

Strategy Design Pattern: This pattern could be used to define a family of algorithms for performing different types of calculations or processing, such as determining the account balance or processing a withdrawal.

Observer Design Pattern: This pattern could be used to establish a one-to-many relationship between objects, where changes to one object trigger updates to one or more other objects, such as updating the inventory list when a new item is added.

It's important to note that the choice of design pattern(s) depends on the specific requirements of the application and the developer's preferences and experience.
